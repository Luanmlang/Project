Please understand that the code may not run if you are on a device that is connected to a public network. 
Bestbuy and nike ddos protections will not allow you to scrape the website and run the program if that is the case
Your device must also have the latest version of chrome to run the program because selenium creates an instance of chrome on your device to 
access the website. 

For testing I recommend that you input the product name: "nike sports band". this is one of the only products that best buy has in common
with nike. 

I will be able to add other vendors later on but these were the vendors I found that were the easiest to bypass bot protection 

If you have any problems running the code please ask me before giving me a zero. 

I assure you it works.
